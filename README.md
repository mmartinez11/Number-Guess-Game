# Introduction
In this game two threads play against each other. Each thread will be given a four digit non-repeating decimal number. Each thread will get a turn to guess the opposing threads
number. The opposing thread will take that guess and let the other thread know the amount of correct digits in the correct positions and in the wrong positions. In addition the 
opposing thread will reveal to the other thread one of the correct digits that was in the wrong position. Each thread will get 20 turns to guess the correct number and win.
